## OBJECTIVE 
While it is acknowledged that ABC Tech has operated as a mid-sized organization within the IT-enabled business segment for over a decade, and has diligently managed IT incidents/tickets within the framework of ITIL practices, including incident management, problem management, change management, and configuration management, recent findings from a customer survey have indicated a poor rating for the incident management process. Despite the maturity of these ITIL practices, an audit has suggested that further improvement initiatives may not provide a significant return on investment. Therefore, it is imperative for ABC Tech's management to address the shortcomings identified in the incident management process and seek viable solutions to enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.


* Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

* Task 2:-Develop a predictive model that assists ABC Tech in anticipating and identifying viable solutions for enhancing the incident management process. The aim             is to ensure improvements that lead to heightened levels of customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
  
* Task 3:- Prepare the analysis report stating how model will help expanding the business by stating several factors including feature importance.




## Domain Analysis: Enhancing IT Service Management at ABC Tech


Domain: IT Service Management (ITSM) in the context of ABC Tech, a mid-size organization operating in the IT-enabled business sector.
  
(A) Organization Profile:
    
* ABC Tech has been operating as a mid-size organization in the IT-enabled business segment for over a decade.
* The company receives a significant volume of IT incidents/tickets, averaging between 22,000 to 25,000 incidents.
* ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) framework is employed for incident management, problem management, change management, and configuration         management processes.


(B) ITIL Practices:
  
* The ITIL practices implemented by ABC Tech have achieved a mature process level, as evidenced by a recent audit.
* 
Despite the maturity of these practices, the audit suggests that further improvement initiatives may not provide a notable return on investment.

(C) Incident Management Improvement:
*  
Recent customer survey results indicate dissatisfaction with the incident management process, rating it as poo
* In response to these findings, ABC Tech management is actively seeking ways to enhance incident management to improve overall customer satisfaction.

(D) Introduction of Machine Learning (ML):

* ABC Tech management has recently explored the potential of leveraging Machine Learning (ML) techniques to enhance ITSM processes.
* ML is perceived as a promising approach for improving ITSM processes through prediction and automation.son.

(E) Key Areas Identified for ML Implementation:
* Predicting High Priority Tickets:
  ML can be used to predict high priority tickets (Priority 1 & 2), allowing proactive measures to prevent or address issues before they escalate.
* Incident Volume Forecasting:
  ML techniques can forecast incident volumes across different fields on a quarterly and annual basis, facilitating better resource allocation and technology          planning..
* Automatic Ticket Tagging:
  ML algorithms can automatically tag tickets with the appropriate priorities and assign them to the relevant departments, reducing reassignments and associated       delays.



* Predicting RFCs and ITSM Asset Misconfigurations:
  ML models can predict Request for Change (RFC) occurrences and identify potential failures or misconfigurations in ITSM assets, enabling preemptive actions to       mitigate risks.




#### Conclusion:
* The domain analysis provides insights into the challenges faced by ABC Tech in managing IT incidents and the potential of Machine Learning to address these          challenges.
* By applying ML techniques in key areas such as ticket prioritization, incident forecasting, automatic tagging, and risk prediction, ABC Tech aims to enhance its     ITSM processes, thereby improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
